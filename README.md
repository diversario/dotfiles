## dotfiles

#### Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:diversario/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will *overwrite* existing files in your $HOME! See `configs` for files that will be overwritten.

#### Compatibility

You should run zsh >= 5.0 and git ~ 1.8.5.
This was put together on a Mac OS X 10.9. I'm sure there are some things that will not work properly on Linux.
